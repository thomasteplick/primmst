# primmst
Find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using the Prim algorithm given the number of vertices in the network
This is a web application written in Go and uses the html/template package to dynamically create the web page.  The user enters the bounds of
the Euclidean graph along with the number of vertices.  The vertices are created randomly.  Up to 500 vertices can be created.  The starting 
vertex can be changed to see the different distances required to construct the tree.  The user enters http://localhost:8080/graphoption in
a web browser to connect to the http server.
